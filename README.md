# About Proto

🚧 **Proto** is Techie Joe’s experimental playground.

- It’s a **test site** where new ideas, tools, and features are tried out before they’re polished.
- Think of it as a **sandbox** — where things may change often, break unexpectedly, or look a little rough around the edges.
- The goal is to **prototype quickly**, learn from experiments, and refine concepts for future projects.
- Visitors should expect a mix of **unfinished work, creative experiments, and tech demos**.

> It’s not a finished product, but a space for exploration.
