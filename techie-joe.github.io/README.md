###### _🧠 What is it about?_

After two decades of engineering, I stopped reinventing solutions and started systematizing them. I’ve found that the best tools are the ones you build yourself. This space is where those solutions live:

- **Maintained Tools** — Libraries and frameworks I actively use.
- **Engineering Patterns** — Practical architecture and clean-code principles.
- **Workflow Accelerators** — Utilities and AI-assisted processes that remove friction.

Everything here is battle-tested in real projects. Take what’s useful, and let's build something great together.
