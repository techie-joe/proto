🛠️ **Hand picked tools and resources**

I build apps and tools to make development faster and smarter. Dive in to see what I’m working on or check out my library of tools on [my website](https://techie-joe.github.io/)!

#### 🧠 What is it about?

In this curated collection of resources, you’ll find practical development practices, articles, tools, frameworks, and design principles to build cleaner, faster and smarter websites and applications. After two decades of engineering, I stopped reinventing solutions and started systematizing them. This is where those solutions live. Find out what suits you, and let’s build something great together.

- **Maintained Tools** — Libraries and frameworks I actively use.
- **Engineering Patterns** — Practical architecture and clean-code principles.
