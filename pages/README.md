# About the Core

_Core is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. **<a href="https://techie-joe.github.io/core">Preview what it looks like</a> or [use it today](#usage).**_

The Core provides a foundation that allows you to **easily apply your own design** or integrate a framework of choice on top. You can style any page just by linking them to a custom layout. Your site can be written in **Markdown** and **HTML**, and **GitHub Pages** will build your site directly from the content of your repository.

The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a **quick and easy way to build a website**. We aim to meet the needs of the vast majority of users out of the box, by prioritizing **simplicity** rather than flexibility. For those with specific needs or wish to customize further, they may add custom CSS or modify the default layout.

## Usage

To use the theme, add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
remote_theme: techie-joe/core
# the location of the remote_theme.

plugins:
- jekyll-remote-theme
# add jekyll-remote-theme to the plugins list.
```

## Customizing

### Configuration variables

Core will respect the following variables, if set in your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
title: # the title of your site (best without the punctuation dot).
description: # a short description of your site's purpose.
```

Additionally, you may choose to set the following optional variables:

```yml
google_analytics: # your Google Analytics tracking ID.
# to track your website using Google Analytics.

show_downloads: # true or false (unquoted).
# indicate whether to provide a download URL.
```

### Stylesheet

If you'd like to add your own custom styles:

1. Create a file called `/assets/css/style.scss` in your site.
2. Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown:

    ```scss
    ---
    ---
    @import "{{ site.theme }}";
    ```

3. Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the `@import` line.

*Note: If you'd like to change the template's Sass variables, you must set new values before the `@import` line in your stylesheet.*

### Layouts

If you'd like to change the template's HTML layout:

1. For some changes such as a custom `favicon`, you can add custom files in your local `_includes` folder. The files [provided with the template](https://github.com/techie-joe/core/tree/master/_includes) provide a starting point and are included by the [original layout template](https://github.com/techie-joe/core/blob/master/_layouts/default.html).
2. For more extensive changes, [copy the original template](https://github.com/techie-joe/core/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) from the template's repository.<br />(*Pro-tip: click "raw" to make copying easier*)
3. Create a file called `/_layouts/default.html` in your site.
4. Paste the default layout content copied in the first step.
5. Customize the layout as you'd like.

### Customizing Google Analytics code

Google has released several iterations to their Google Analytics code over the years since this template was first created. If you would like to take advantage of the latest code, paste it into `_includes/google-analytics.html` in your Jekyll site.

### Overriding GitHub-generated URLs

Templates often rely on URLs supplied by GitHub such as links to your repository or links to download your project. If you'd like to override one or more default URLs:

1. Look at [the template source](https://github.com/techie-joe/core/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) to determine the name of the variable. It will be in the form of `{{ site.github.zip_url }}`.
2. Specify the URL that you'd like the template to use in your site's `_config.yml`. For example, if the variable was `site.github.url`, you'd add the following:

    ```yml
    github:
        zip_url: http://example.com/download.zip
        # another_url: another_value
    ```

3. When your site is built, Jekyll will use the URL you specified, rather than the default one provided by GitHub.

*Note: You must remove the `site.` prefix, and each variable name (after the `github.`) should be indent with two space below `github:`.*

For more information, see [the Jekyll variables documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/).

## Previewing

If you'd like to preview your site on your computer (for example, in the process of proposing a change), you need to clone the template's repository (`git clone https://github.com/techie-joe/core`).

### Preview with Gem

Add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
```

-->
<!--

## Previewing the template locally

If you'd like to preview the template locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):

1. Clone down the template's repository (`git clone https://github.com/techie-joe/core`)
2. `cd` into the template's directory
3. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
5. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the template

-->
<!--

## Running tests

The template contains a minimal test suite, to ensure a site with the template would build successfully. To run the tests, simply run `script/cibuild`. You'll need to run `script/bootstrap` once before the test script will work.
